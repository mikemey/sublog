## A short description of the markdown style

A full description can be found here: [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### HEADERS:

with a number of leading hash `#` characters:

# \# Header1
## \#\# Header2
### \#\#\# Header3
#### \#\#\#\# Header4
##### \#\#\#\#\# Header5
###### \#\#\#\#\#\# Header6

### EMPHASIS:

with different leading and trailing characters:
Emphasis, aka italics, with \**asterisks*\* or _\_underscores\__

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with \*\***asterisks**\*\* or __\_\_underscores\_\___

### LINKS:

A link with a label: [An inline-style link](https://www.google.com) is written as 

`[An inline-style link](https://www.google.com)`

For more organised peoples and/or scientists - there is also a reference

### IMAGES:

`![alternative text](http://www.url.to/image.png "Logo Hover Text")` will show: ![alternative text](/static/sublog.png "Logo Hover Text")

Similar to links a reference style organisation of the images is possible.

### SYNTAX AND QUOTATIONS:

a separate quotation can be done \``with single back-ticks`\`

### NOT SUPPORTED:

- Tables
- Block quotation
- Strike through using tildes
- and maybe more - not yet tested
